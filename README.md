### Introduction

This list will allow you to complete a working FM Radio Receiver using the Raspberry PI 3b+ in conjunction with a TEA5767 I2C device.

Ill start by listing the required components, where to buy them, how to design then assemble those components, then finalize with testing the device in an appropriate enviroment.

This project was completed over a 15-week semester, however with these steps, a working prototype could be completed in a week from purchasing components to hearing music on the receiver.

### Specifications
Heres a list of all parts needed to complete this project.

### Design Files
To design these files (for the device PCB, as well as the enclosure) I used the freeware "Fritzing" which is in BETA at the time of this publication. And for the enclosure, CorelDRAW was used on a free 15-day trial as well as access to the program in our lab.

This files could still use some tweaking, and maybe some personal customization; however, this is the simplest design I could create and good for a beginner to learn the basics.

Same goes for the Enclosure here on CorelDRAW:
