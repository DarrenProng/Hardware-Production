		The speakers at the time of ordering werent available;

		I added them in anyways as it could give me opitons later on down the road if I want to upgrade.
		I also have a spare set of tweeters floating around my apartment that I could use instead.
		The PI b+, the Class D amplifier, and the TEA5767 was all purchased on the 16th.
