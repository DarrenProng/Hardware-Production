### Introduction
![Image of Prototype](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarrenProng/Hardware-Production/master/images/CurrentSetup.jpg)

This list will allow you to complete a working FM Radio Receiver using the Raspberry PI 3b+ in conjunction with a TEA5767 I2C device.

Ill start by listing the required components, where to buy them, how to design then assemble those components, then finalize with testing the device in an appropriate enviroment.

This project was completed over a 15-week semester, however with these steps, a working prototype could be completed in a week from purchasing components to hearing music on the receiver.
